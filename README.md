# Overview
I spent the last year self-teaching Power Query, Dax, and M-Code for my previous employer without the ability to showcase any of that progress on here due to company policy. Unfortunately, the majority of my team was laid off due to a shift in company priority and leadership. I thought it would be a good idea to at least begin posting my current 
efforts to get back into the meat and potatoes of Data Analytics by sharing some projects done for a refresher course on Codecademy. These are generally simple tasks with some real-world application.

## Looking ahead
I have ideas for some interesting personal projects I'd like to complete while looking for employment, so please feel free to check back in if you are a curious passerby, or a potential employer I've submitted an application to. 

Thank you!
